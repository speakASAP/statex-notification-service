We're looking to develop a comprehensive SaaS platform for project management that goes beyond the typical offerings in the market. We need something that can intelligently prioritize tasks using AI, provide real-time collaboration features for our distributed teams, and integrate seamlessly with our existing development workflow including GitHub, Jira, and Slack. The platform needs to support both web and mobile interfaces, with enterprise-grade security since we're targeting Fortune 500 companies. We're particularly interested in advanced analytics and reporting capabilities that can provide insights into team productivity and project health. Our budget is flexible - we're looking at somewhere between $120,000 to $180,000, and we'd like to launch within 6 months if possible. We've done our market research and believe there's a significant opportunity here, especially with AI-powered features. We need a partner who can handle the full development lifecycle from architecture design to deployment and ongoing support.",
